 * => calcul le repère TBN : tangente, bitangent, normal utilise pour l'eclairage par pixel
 * ATTENTION !! pour le moment le nombre de vertex du vset en sortie peut etre augmente, si le nombre de face 
 * reste identique l'ordre des vertex peut etre change. 
 *computeNormals == true : les normales de vset sont effacees, et recalculees
 *computeNormals == false : les normales de vset sont preservees et utilisees pour le calcul du repere TBN
 *minNormalsCreaseCosAngle - the minimum cosine of the angle between normals
 *							 so that they are allowed to be smoothed together
 *							 ranges between -1.0 and +1.0
 *							 this is ignored if computeNormals is set to false
 *							 
 *
 *minTangentsCreaseCosAngle - the minimum cosine of the angle between tangents
 *							  so that they are allowed to be smoothed together
 *							  ranges between -1.0 and +1.0
 *
 *minBinormalsCreaseCosAngle - the minimum cosine of the angle between binormals
 *							   so that they are allowed to be smoothed together
 *		 					   ranges between -1.0 and +1.0
 *
 *weightNormalsByArea - an ammount to blend the normalized face normal, and the 
 *						unnormalized face normal together.  Thus weighting the
 *						normal by the face area by a given ammount
 *						ranges between 0.0 and +1.0
 *						0.0 means use the normalized face normals (not weighted by area)
 *						1.0 means use the unnormalized face normal(weighted by area)
 *						this is ignored if computeNormals is set to false
